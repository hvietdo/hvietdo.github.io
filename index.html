    About me
</h2>    
<p>
    My full name is Hoang Viet Do (and Đỗ Hoàng Việt in Vietnamese). I am a former Master's student at <a href="http://math.ac.vn/en/trang-chu/gioi-thieu-vien-toan.html" target="_blank" >Hanoi Institute of Mathematics (IMH)</a> and was supervised by Professor <a href="http://math.ac.vn/en/component/staff/?task=getProfile&staffID=64" target="_blank" >Ngo Viet Trung</a>. You can find my <a href="docs/CV.pdf" target="_blank">curriculum vitae</a> and <a href="docs/MasterThesis.pdf" target="_blank">my thesis</a>. My interests include (Algebraic and Geometric) Combinatorics, Commutative Algebra, (Algebraic and Fractal) Geometry and Probability. 
<p>    
    Prior to my Master's studies, I studied at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, <a href="https://www.hcmus.edu.vn/" target="_blank" >VNUHCM-University of Science</a> where I started mathematical research under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/mai-hoang-bien" target="_blank" >Mai Hoang Bien</a>. You can find my senior dissertation <a href="docs/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

    Academic Activities
</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Since July 2024, I have joined the <a href="https://institute.vinbigdata.org/programs/application-driven-mathematics/" target="_blank">Application Driven Mathematics</a> where I have been supervised by Professors <a href="https://tuaentran.wixsite.com/homepage" target="_blank"> Tuan Tran</a> and <a href="https://people.math.osu.edu/nguyen.1261/" target="_blank">Nguyen Huu Hoi</a> on The High-Dimensional Probability and Combinatorial Statistics, especially The Inverse Littlewood–Offord problems.</li>
        <li> Since 2023, I have been involved in a project on Combinatorial Commutative Algebra of Professor Ngo Viet Trung and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ngdhop/algebra-and-related-fields" target="_blank">Doctor Nguyen Dang Hop </a>. Our work is supported by the National Foundation for Science and Technology.</li> 
        <li> From 2022 to 2024, thanks to <a href="https://www.fellowshipgradstudiesmathvn.org/" target="_blank">The Fellowship for Pre-Graduate Studies in Mathematics</a>, I studied Spectral Theory, Fractal and Hyperbolic Geometry under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/koberdat/home" target="_blank">Professor Thomas Koberda</a> via a reading seminar.</li>   
        <li> In my undergraduate study, I researched Group and Graph Theory under the guidance of Professor Mai Hoang Bien. Additionally, my research team organized a seminar to study Character Theory.</li>

<h2>
    Teaching Experience 
</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> In the summer of 2024, I served as a mentor at <a href="https://pimavn.github.io/" target="_blank">The Projects in Mathematics and Applications</a> where I compiled tests and lectures as well as interviewed candidates.</li>
        <li> In Spring 2023, I was the main Instructor for the selected team from VNUHCM-US that participated in the Vietnam Mathematical Olympiad for Undergraduates. I gave lectures on problem-solving strategies in algebra and combinatorics.</li>
        <li> In Spring 2022, I was a teaching assistant of four classes of freshman (21CTT3A, 21CTT3B, 21TNT1B and 21TTH1TN) at VNUHCM-University of Science. I conducted weekly recitation sessions on Linear and Abstract Algebra for 120 undergraduate students majoring in Information Science and Mathematics.</li>
        <li> In Spring 2021, I organized the <a href="https://www.hvietdo.com/posts/2021/02/20/Character-theory-learning-seminar/" target="_blank">Character Theory Seminar</a> where I delivered lectures at the weekly sessions.
