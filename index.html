    About me
</h2>    
<p>
    My full name is Hoang Viet Do (and Đỗ Hoàng Việt in Vietnamese). I am currently a third-year student at Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, <a href="https://www.hcmus.edu.vn/">VNUHCM-University of Science</a> where I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor <a href="https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/mai-hoang-bien">Mai Hoang Bien</a>. You can find my curriculum vitae at <a href="docs/CVHoangVietDo.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. My interests include the Group theory and Representation theory, specifically the Character theory of finite groups.
</p>
<p>
    In Spring 2021, I have co-run a seminar on <a href="posts/2021/02/20/Character-theory-learning-seminar/" target="_blank">the theory of characters of finite groups</a>.
