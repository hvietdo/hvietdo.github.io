<h2>
    About me
</h2>    
<p>
    My full name is Hoang Viet Do (and Đỗ Hoàng Việt in Vietnamese). I am currently a Master's student at <a href="http://math.ac.vn/en/trang-chu/gioi-thieu-vien-toan.html" target="_blank" >Hanoi Institute of Mathematics (IMH)</a> where I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor <a href="http://math.ac.vn/en/component/staff/?task=getProfile&staffID=64" target="_blank" >Ngo Viet Trung</a>. My interests during Master's period are topics related to Algebraic Combinatorics. In particular, I am conducting a research into combinatorial properties of monomial ideals of polynomial rings. You can find my curriculum vitae at <a href="docs/CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>    
    Prior to Master's period, I studied at Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, <a href="https://www.hcmus.edu.vn/" target="_blank" >VNUHCM-University of Science</a> where I was supervised by Associate Professor <a href="https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/mai-hoang-bien" target="_blank" >Mai Hoang Bien</a>. At university, my interests included the Commutative Algebra, Representation Theory of Finite Groups and Graph Theory. You can find my senior dissertation <a href="docs/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Its topic was intersection graphs of groups, where the group and graph theories intertwine.

    Experience
</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Since July 2022, I have studied a topic related to monomial ideals under the guidance of Professor Ngo Viet Trung. Our work is a part of the training program for young mathematicians at IMH. After a half of the researching process, I completed a <a href="docs/report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> about the connection between the normality of monomial ideals and integer rounding properties.</li>
        <li> In Spring 2022, I was a teaching assistant at my university. I taught two courses: Linear Algebra (MTH00083) for three Computer Science classes, and Abstract Algebra (MTH00084) for one Mathematical class. </li>
        <li> In Spring 2021, I had co-run a seminar on <a href="posts/2021/02/20/Character-theory-learning-seminar/" target="_blank">the theory of characters of finite groups</a>. You can find more information about this seminar in my blog.</li>
