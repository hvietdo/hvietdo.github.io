    About me
</h2>    
<p>
    My full name is Hoang Viet Do (and Đỗ Hoàng Việt in Vietnamese). I am currently a Master's student at <a href="http://math.ac.vn/en/trang-chu/gioi-thieu-vien-toan.html" target="_blank" >Hanoi Institute of Mathematics (IMH)</a>. I am supervised by Professor <a href="http://math.ac.vn/en/component/staff/?task=getProfile&staffID=64" target="_blank" >Ngo Viet Trung</a> conducting researches on Combinatorial Commutative Algebra. You can find my curriculum vitae at <a href="docs/CV.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>    
    Prior to Master's period, I studied at Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, <a href="https://www.hcmus.edu.vn/" target="_blank" >VNUHCM-University of Science</a> where I researched Group and Graph Theory under the guidance of Associate Professor <a href="https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/mai-hoang-bien" target="_blank" >Mai Hoang Bien</a>. You can find my senior dissertation <a href="docs/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

    Activities
</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Since the winter of 2023, I have joint in a project on Combinatorial Commutative Algebra of Professor Ngo Viet Trung and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ngdhop/algebra-and-related-fields" target="_blank">Doctor Nguyen Dang Hop </a> as an assistant. Our work is supported by the National Foundation for Science and Technology.</li> 
        <li> In 2022, thanks to <a href="https://www.fellowshipgradstudiesmathvn.org/" target="_blank">The Fellowship for Pre-Graduate Studies in Mathematics</a>, I have studied Spectral Theory, Fractal and Hyperbolic Geometry under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/koberdat/home" target="_blank">Professor Thomas Koberda</a> via a reading seminar.</li>
